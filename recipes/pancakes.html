<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Pancakes are a flat cake prepared from a starch-based batter and cooked on a
  hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan. They are often thin and round,
  but can also be made thick and fluffy. Pancakes are typically made with flour,
  milk, eggs, and baking powder, and can be sweetened or savory. Pancakes are a
  popular breakfast food in many cultures around the world. They are often
  served with syrup, butter, fruit, and whipped cream.
