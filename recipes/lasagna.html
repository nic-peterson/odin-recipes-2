<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Lasagna is a layered pasta dish made with wide, flat noodles, typically
  alternating with layers of tomato sauce, meat sauce, béchamel sauce, cheese,
  and seasonings. The dish is then baked in an oven until the pasta is cooked
  through and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Lasagna is a hearty and
  satisfying dish that is perfect for a special occasion or a casual family
  meal. It is also a versatile dish that can be adapted to different dietary
  needs and preferences. For example, vegetarian lasagnas can be made with
  layers of vegetables, tofu, or lentils instead of meat.

    with tomatoes, onions, garlic, herbs, and spices.

    cooked in a tomato sauce.
